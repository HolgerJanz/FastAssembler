## Version 1.7
Last original release by MMMG Soft from 1995

This is the original Fast Assembler package delivered with SpartaDOS X Toolkit Disk up to version 4.49.

It was developed by Marek Goderski from MMMG Soft (Free MG). He was so kind to release Fast Assembler
to Public Domain.

Fast Assembler 1.7 uses undocumented features for parameter parsing. These features have been removed with SpartaDOS X 4.47 and reintroduced with 4.49e. For this, Fast Assembler 1.7 will only work with SpartaDOS X versions below 4.47 or above 4.49d. Furthermore it has some issues (see fixes in version 1.8).

This package is kept for archiving and historical reasons.
