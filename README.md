# Fast Assembler

Assembler for SpartaDOS X on Atari 8bit.

## Version 1.7

This is the original Fast Assembler package delivered with SpartaDOS X Toolkit Disk up to version 4.49.

Fast Assembler 1.7 uses undocumented features for parameter parsing. These features have been removed with SpartaDOS X 4.47 and reintroduced with 4.49e. For this it will only work with versions below 4.47 or above 4.49d.

## Version 1.8

- fixed parameter parsing issue that prevents FA working with SpartaDOS 4.47 to 4.49d

- fixed issue with percentage display for pass progress

- add line number to source output

- condense info output 

- update copyright message

Works with all versions of SpartaDOS X.
